=================

This is the repo for our Software Systems Lab (CS-296) course project.
We have built and simulated a working bulldozer in this project using 
Box-2D physics engine.

Group Members:
Shyam JVS (Roll no 120050052)
Sumanth Vakulabharanam (Roll no 120050069)
Soma Naik B (Roll no 120050080)

The controls for this have been written in the project webpage.
(Link to the page: http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~jvs/project.html)
These controls help move the bulldozer in different ways.
